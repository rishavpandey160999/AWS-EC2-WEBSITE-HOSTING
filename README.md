# AWS-EC2-WEBSITE-HOSTING
Learnt about all the services offered by an extremely secure cloud service provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) and implemented practically by launching an AWS EC2 Instance. I even used other services of AWS like storage services (AWS S3) and security services (IAM). After launching the instance I secure shelled into the same and further hosted a website named 'Saving Paws' on that virtual server.
